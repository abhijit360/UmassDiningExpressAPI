Express JS API
This is a simple API that I wanted to build as project to learn more about web APIs. 

- Supabase: I worked with the supabase JS client and wrote out postgreSQL functions to create my endpoints. I realised that I must be careful with my cases. Note: Look at databases -> function tab on supabase for the implementation, if you get confused in the future.
